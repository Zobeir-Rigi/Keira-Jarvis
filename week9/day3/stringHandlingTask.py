# Note: files for the tasks below are in the 


# To Do:

# Task 1 Working with comparison operators" # != , == , <= , >=, <,>
#  use any comparison operator to compare the letter "a" and "A"
#  use any comparison operator to compare the letters "ax" and "ZZ"
#  use any comparison operator to compare your firstname with any another first name


# Task 2
# Create two variables fName and lName and join and print them using a variable called fullName
fName = "saeid"
lName :"rigi"
fullName = fName + lName

# Task 3: print a specific character using the index value or position in a string or list?
course = "Python"
findChar = course[1]
print(findChar)


# Task 4: Write the code to print the letter h from the variable below 
course = "Python"
char = "h"
for c in course:
    if c == char:
        print(c)

# Extension activity: Research and independent learning activity

# Task 1: Return all the characters from the string held in the course variable using negative values

# Task 2: Research and independent learning activity
# Open the Python documentation using the provided link to discover uses of :
str.capitalize()
str.title()
str.swapcase()
https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=substring#string-methods
text = "Hello World"
swapped_text = text.swapcase()
print(swapped_text)  # Output: "hELLO wORLD"
